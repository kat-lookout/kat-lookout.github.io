I've been less focused on maintaining my reading "streak" lately; it was getting cumbersome and stressful. I've
also pretty much given up on _The Wheel Of Time_ in audiobook format yet again. Epic Fantasy and I just don't really
get along well. Too much worldbuilding and not enough action or exploration of concepts. I also noticed more and
more a subtle sexism in this series, and it's getting annoying.

I finally got around to John Green's _The Fault in our Stars_. I got back to watching [Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/@vlogbrothers),
and there's currently a lot of content surrounding the release of John's latest, _Everything Is Tuberculosis_,
which I also want to read. I already had a copy of _The Fault in our Stars_, though, so seemed like a reasonable place
to start.

John has a really interesting writer's voice. It is, of course, not super different from his "normal" voice, or at
least the voice I've become accustomed to hearing in his Vlogbrothers videos. It is at once irreverant and
thoughtful, and I enjoy it. It can't decide if it makes the characters in _The Fault in our Stars_ sound
older than they actually are. After all, they are teenagers dealing with a very adult set of diseases and the
issues that come up with those. I'll be interested to read John's other young adult novels and compare.

I'm also enjoying _The Blood of the Lamb_ so far, although it's early yet. Similar voice, and I've found myself
reaching for the dictionary (or more accurately, highlighting and hitting "Look Up", since I'm reading this one
in e-book format) more often in this book. I do enjoy an author with a broad vocabulary.

_Predictably Irrational_ was a good listen; not only for the subject matter, but for the narrator. Simon Jones
played Arthur Dent in one of the adaptations of _The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, and his narrative voice
reminded me so much of the voice of the Guide in [this more recent adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_hitchikers%2520guide)
that I had to look up the actor that actually did provide the voice to be sure.

Tolstoy's _The Kingdom of God is Within You_ is likely to get set aside, as I'm planning on using it for
another little project I have in mind. Edward Rutherford's _London_ is good, just long, and my brain
doesn't want to sit still long enough to read 90 minute chapters right now.
